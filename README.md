# TO DO App
It's a TO DO app in the terminal! You can add tasks, mark them as done and delete them.

## Usage
Move into the 'source/'.
Use 'make run' to build and run it automatically.
Use 'make build' to obtain the 'todo' executable.
You have 4 possible actions:
    1. Add a task
    2. Mark a task as done
    3. Delete a task
    4. Quit the app
Quitting the app will write the list to 'newlist.txt' and print it again on the screen.

## This currently works on Linux machines only.
